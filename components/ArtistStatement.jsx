            As an 8th grade artist I can research stories and inspiration from artworks and my personal interests; and from that idea I can sketch and adapt the idea, manage a work plan, and make a result that I can showcase in my own gallery space.

            This year I was inspired to make musical and digital works of art. I was inspired by the artwork made by Dream Theater.
            Dream Theater is a band from Long Island who make progressive symphonic power metal music, which combines metal, rock, classical, and good lyrics. I found them through poking around in the world of music. They use electric guitars, bass, drums, keyboard, and other normal rock instruments, as well as using orchestras.

            I was also inspired by Hugh Syme.
            Hugh Syme is the artist who creates album art for the band Rush. He generally uses edited and stitched-together camera shots. Some of the covers were painted. I learned about Rush from our vinyl collection.

            The most favorite piece of artwork I researched this year was the album cover for Rushâ€™s A Farewell to Kings, which includes a puppet king on a throne in a castle ruin, with a city in the background.

            When I look at this piece it makes me feel a bit sad for the modern world. I feel this because the cover of the album shows a castle ruin, with a puppet king, and a city with visible pollution.

            My favorite piece of art that I made this year was a musical piece called Whispers on the Wind (which is not on the website). I am very interested in classical music. Things that I like to make art about include books and flights of fancy. I am really into these things because I read books regularly, and my imagination likes to run wild.


            I think my favorite art project is really successful because it uses some of the elements of art in really effective ways.

            This may seem odd, but to me, the piece has many shifting colors. It generally shifts between blue and green, with occasional red and grey. There are no straight lines, except perhaps the fence depicted in measures 32 through 35.
